Data Quality Dimensions
Age - what was the last time each record was updated?
Completeness - Are all key business fields on records filled in?
Accuracy - Has it been matched against a trusted source?
Consistency - is the same formatting, spelling and language used across records?
Duplication - Are records and data duplicated in your org?
Usage - Is your data being harnessed in reports, dashboards and apps?

Standards for creating, processing and maintaining data
Formatting - Figure out how dates and money are represented.
Workflow - Determine processes for record creation, reviewing, updating and archiving. Determine all the stages a record goes through during its life cycle.
Quality - Set appropriate standards for data quality.
Roles and Ownership - Determine the appropriate levels of privacy for data.
Make sure to comply with regulatory, legal and contractual obligations.
Monitoring - Outline a process for ensuring quality control of data.

Steps to clean your data to make it AI ready
Remove duplicate or irrelevant observations/records - Duplications happen when you combine data sets from multiple places and duplicate entries are created.
Fix Structural errors: This happens when data includes typos, incorrect capitalization or mislabeling.
Filter unwanted outliers - There are often one-off observations that don't appear to align with the data you are analyzing. That might be the result of incorrect data entry.
Handle missing data - Eliminate observations that include missing values, input missing values based on other observations or consider altering the way the data is used to effectively navigate the missing values.
Validate - Does the data make sense, does the data follow the appropriate rules for its field?

Data Management Best Practices
Build a Data Management Strategy - A clear data strategy helps keep your organization on track. It's a great way to align your team on how data will be collected, reviewed and used to drive your business goals.
Improve data quality - Tracking, reporting and the effectiveness of your Salesforce deployment depend on getting clean data.
Import Data - Bring your existing data into Salesforce so you can include past records in your tracking and reporting.
Maintain and Clean Up Data - Remove duplicates.
